# Basic-solidity-basic-practice-questions
My journey of learning Solidity step by step through 
practice contracts covering variables, arrays, mappings, structs, events, modifiers, and more.

1. Variables & Functions (10)

Store & retrieve uint

Update string with two functions (setName / getName)

Boolean setter/getter

Increment / Decrement counter

Multiply two numbers

Divide two numbers with require (no divide by 0)

Modulo of two numbers

Compare two numbers (return bigger)

Concatenate two strings

Square / cube of a number

2. Conditionals (if/else, require, assert) (10)

Check even or odd

Check positive/negative

Grade system (marks → grade)

Min/Max of 3 numbers

Check voting eligibility (age >= 18)

Check password (string match)

Simple login (bool check)

Require example (number > 100)

Assert example (number != 0)

Custom error example

3. Arrays (10)

Store numbers in array

Get element by index

Update element in array

Delete element

Dynamic push/pop

Find length of array

Sum of all elements

Find max in array

Find min in array

Search element in array

4. Mappings (10)

Address → balance mapping

String → uint mapping (name → marks)

Add & update mapping values

Delete mapping entry

Check if key exists (bool return)

Simple phone book

Nested mapping (address → (string → uint))

Voting count mapping

Whitelist mapping (true/false)

Blacklist mapping

5. Structs (10)

Student struct (id, name, marks)

Add multiple students in array

Update student marks

Retrieve student by id

Employee struct (id, name, salary)

Add/update employee

Product struct (id, name, price)

Add/update product

Car struct (brand, model, year)

Store multiple cars

6. Modifiers (5)

OnlyOwner modifier

OnlyPositiveNumber modifier

OnlyStudent modifier

MinBalance modifier

FunctionCounter modifier

7. Events (5)

Emit event on deposit

Emit event on withdrawal

Emit event on student added

Emit event on marks updated

Emit event on ownership transfer

8. Payable & Ether (10)

Deposit function

Withdraw function

Check balance function

Transfer ether to another address

Fallback function example

Receive function example

Track deposits with event

Limit deposit amount (require < 1 ETH)

Simple donation contract

Withdraw onlyOwner

9. Inheritance & OOP (10)

Parent → Child contract (simple function inherit)

Multilevel inheritance (Grandparent → Parent → Child)

Function overriding

Virtual & override example

Abstract contract

Interface example

Multiple inheritance

Call parent function from child

Base contract with constructor

Derived contract with super keyword

10. Mini Projects (20)

Simple Calculator

Simple Bank (multi user)

Voting system

To-do list

Auction (basic, highest bidder wins)

Crowdfunding (basic target based)

Lottery (pick winner randomly with block data)

Token (ERC20 simplified)

NFT (ERC721 simplified)

Certificate generator (store hash of doc)

Exam system (students attempt, store marks)

Library management (books issue/return)

Attendance system

Expense tracker

E-commerce (add products, buy)

Simple chat log (store messages)

Ownership transfer system

Land registry (store land info)

Multi-sig wallet (basic approval)

Escrow contract
